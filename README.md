# Materialist app
I use the [model](https://github.com/lloydf96/Materialist_2021) I had trained on [iMaterialist-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-fashion-2021-fgvc8/data) dataset to develop a web app using Flask with front end developed using HTML and CSS. This web app is then dockerised into a image and pushed to container registry and hosted on Cloud Run in Google Cloud platform.
